This is an attempt to get a Map Reduce framework in Python that is compabible with the python code from http://jsmapreduce.com/

It is simple and probably doesn't implement everything jsmapreduce does, but it works.

To use this copy the Mappper and Reducer (and optionally the Kernel) to your local system.  At the top of each add "import JSMrClone".At the end of each add ...

in Mapper:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    util = JSMrClone.JSMrClone()
    util.Map(sys.stdin, Mapper)


in Reducer:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    util = JSMrClone.JSMrClone()
    util.Reduce(sys.stdin, Reducer)


in Kernel:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    Kernel(JSMrClone.JSMrClone())


to invoke the full chain call:
python kernel.py | python map.py | sort | python reduce.py


Any stage of the output can be saved for debugging or use later.  Tweak the "main" calls if something other than pipes is needed to integrate everything.
